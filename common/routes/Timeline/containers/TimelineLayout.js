        <li>Focused on understanding the written portions of our damages reports. Attempted report writing.</li>

    <StickyContainer>
      <Sticky className={css(styles.h3)}>2013</Sticky>
      <ul>
        <li>Crunch-time at J.P. Morgan. Nine months into my job, three senior analysts and a banker jumped ship. Inherited a lot of responsibility very quickly.</li>
        <li>Somehow managed to sneak in enough studying to pass CFA Level I.</li>
        <li>Held down the fort by learning to delegate and to think/act quickly/decisively.</li>

    <StickyContainer>
      <Sticky className={css(styles.h3)}>2012</Sticky>
      <ul>
        <li>Year of change.</li>
        <li>Hit the ground running at J.P. Morgan. I was out to prove to the world that I could cut it in finance.</li>

        <li>Went through J.P. Morgan Private Bank's Summer Training program. Learned a whole bunch. Nightly reviewed everything twice to be sure it stuck.</li>
        <li>Travelled Europe with a friend made studying abroad in Buenos Aires the prior year.</li>
        <li>Graduated from college. Wondered whether my Spanish degree would be helpful on Wall Street (I'm sort of giving myself a hard time here. Honestly though, I couldn't have a greater appreciation for my liberal arts education. While it's easy to poke fun, I do credit it for cultivating my intellectual curiosity and a desire to learn).</li>
      </ul>

    <StickyContainer>
      <Sticky className={css(styles.h3)}>2011</Sticky>

        <li>Stayed late after work each night to read Investopedia and write financial definitions in a journal. I re-read this financial diary every morning before work.</li>
        <li>Prepared like mad for the one finance interview I received. Converted it into an internship offer.</li>
        <li>Earned my internship interview by reaching out to hundreds of Davidson College alumni.</li>
